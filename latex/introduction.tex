\subsection{Introduction}



It is common place for a complex electrical mechanical system to have a hybrid controller.  
Essentially different controllers are needed when the system is in different states or doing different tasks.
For the remainder of this document the complex electro mechanical system that I will be talkking about are robots.
The majority of examples given will be in reference to humanoid robotics and the Hubo2+ (KHR-4+) platform.
The Hubo platform is discribed in Section~\ref{sec:hubo}.

A complete autonomous system is an electro mechanical mechanism that is cabiable of making its own decisions.
The combination of high degree of freedom and requirement for autonomy makes the work space broad.
The decisions made are high level and low level.
High level decisions take care of objectives such as \textit{where to go} and \textit{what to pick up}. 
These decisions are like our concious decisions.
Low level decisions take care of balancing, inverse kinimatics etc.
These decisions can be compaired to our unconscious responses to stimuli, such as balancing, sitting, breating etc.

My work shows an experimentally viable way of creating a complete autonomous system.  
As proof of viability I show the basic structure of my system in Section~\ref{sec:hubo-ach}.  
I give step by step examples in Section~\ref{sec:simpleExamples}.
Section~\ref{sec:simulator} shows how we can move from real-time to using a simulated version of the platform in simulation time without having to change the controller.
Section~\ref{sec:task} discribes the experiment which consists of making the robot proform an advanced task that pulls together visual, kinimatic, path planning and other controllers together using this one system.
Section~\ref{sec:results} shows the results of the experiment thus show the viability of the system.
Lastly Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} discusses the results of the work and the future of this system.


In July 2012 DARPA released a solicitation for proposals to compeat in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC).
The DRC is a challenge that is in direct response to the Tsuanmi in Psuicima in 2010 (check this).
The challenge is to have a robot be able to use human tools, human vehicles and proform human tasks in an un-structured un modified human enviroment.
We applied for the grant.
In October 2012 we received word that we are a Track-A team for the DRC.
This means that we are competing agains NASA, Raythion, CMU and a team from Japan.
One of the keys to our team is our collaberation.
We are partnered with WPI, Georgia Tech, University of Delleware, Swarthmore, Purdue, Ohio State (check that) and RAINBOW (a company that rose from the Hubo Lab at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)).
Each partner would be responsiable with one event.
We will then combine our efforts into one master controller that is cabiable of doing all the given tasks.
Having a multi-process system that also gives us the ability for our partners to share their controllers without having to intergrate their code.  
Controllers run indipendently.

%This is demonstrated through experimentation on multiple electro mechanical platforms.
%The primary platform focused on in this document is the Hubo 2 and the Hubo 2+ full-size humanoid robot.
%The Hubo platform is discribed in Section~\ref{sec:hubo}.




\begin{itemize}
\item Creating a system that can monitor its self
\item Avoid self collisions
\item Plan future movements
\item Proform these plans with a higher archical structure such that it stays stable and safe among all else.
\end{itemize}
