In July 2012 DARPA released a solicitation for proposals to compeat in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC).
The DRC is a challenge that is in direct response to the Tsuanmi in Psuicima in 2010 (check this).
The challenge is to have a robot be able to use human tools, human vehicles and proform human tasks in an un-structured un modified human enviroment.
We applied for the grant.
In October 2012 we received word that we are a Track-A team for the DRC.
This means that we are competing agains NASA, Raythion, CMU and a team from Japan.
One of the keys to our team is our collaberation.
We are partnered with WPI, Georgia Tech, University of Delleware, Swarthmore, Purdue, Ohio State (check that) and RAINBOW (a company that rose from the Hubo Lab at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)).
Each partner would be responsiable with one event.
We will then combine our efforts into one master controller that is cabiable of doing all the given tasks.
Having a multi-process system that also gives us the ability for our partners to share their controllers without having to intergrate their code.  
Controllers run indipendently.
