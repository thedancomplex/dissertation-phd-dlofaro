The primary contributions to the field of complete complex systems and robotics is the creation of control system that allows for fast parallel development of controllers for these complex systems in both physical and simulated environments.
Splitting each controller into separate processes allows for multiple control periods, robustness against complete system failure and is conducive for a parallel development environment.
The use of SI units for all \textit{state} data makes it non-robot specific.
Hubo-Ach is an OpenSource BSD licensed software allowing for open use.

The contributions of my thesis has been confirmed by multiple IEEE publications and articles.
I have been featured as 

What constitutes a vertical leap and what needs to be done, i.e. where is it in this document.
\begin{itemize}
\item Higher archical system that keeps base functionality
\item How to make the decisions
\item Sensor integration into control 
\item Software structure that allows for multi-user implementation with a reduce risk of segfaulting 
\item Compliance: what is it and how do we fake it with our robot
\end{itemize}
