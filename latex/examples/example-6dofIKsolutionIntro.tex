In order to control the Hubo's upper body manipulators in work space as opposed to joint space both forward and inverse kinematics are required, (FK) and (IK) respectively.
In order to find a proper solution the joint limits, singularities and feasible workspace (no-self collisions) must be accounted for.

The kinematic structure of the right and left arm of the Hubo are identical with the caveat that the work space offset is mirrored over the z-axis.
This means that they have the same Denavit–Hartenberg (DH) parameters
