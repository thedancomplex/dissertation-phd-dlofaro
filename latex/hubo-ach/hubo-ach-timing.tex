To ensure that the Hubo-Ach controller is able to run at the desired control rates, timing experiments of each part of the controller was taken.
All tests were done with a sample step size of $0.005~sec$.
Each of the following figures have the same X and Y scale.
This is to give a visual representation of how much each portion of the cycle each part of Hubo-Ach takes up.




Fig.~\ref{fig:timing-getRef} shows the amount of time it takes to request and get the reference for the actuators.
This reads the most recent reference off of the feedforward channel and uses that as the reference used in this cycle of Hubo-Ach.
This time is measured to be $0.0010~ms$ with micro-second accuracy.
The standard deviation is $0.0028$.



Fig.~\ref{fig:timing-doCmd} shows the amount of time it takes to complete all unread commands given by the user via the console.
User commands are manual actions such as homing individual or all joints, resetting actuator errors, and reading error states.
This time is measured to be $0.011~ms$ with micro-second accuracy.
The standard deviation is $0.0.0033$.


Fig.~\ref{fig:timing-getTrigger} shows the amount of time it takes to send the external trigger.  
This external trigger tells a controller or simulator when the new reference's and commands have been read.
In real-time mode the measured time delay is $0.0014~ms$ with micro-second accuracy and a standard deviation of $0.0035$.


Fig.~\ref{fig:timing-filter} shows the amount of time it takes to process the built in filter.
This filter has multiple options:
\begin{itemize}
\item Direct reference mode where the filter acts as a reference pass through (Section~\ref{sec:singlejointStep}.
\item Low pass filter based on previous reference commands (Section~\ref{sec:singlejointFilter}.
\item Low pass filter using feedback from the actual position of the joint (Section~\ref{sec:singlejointEnc}).
\item Compliance amplification mode which artificially increases the compliance of the joint (Section~\ref{sec:singlejointRefComplience})
The measured time delay is $0.0080~ms$ with micro-second accuracy.
The standard deviation is $0.0030~ms$.
\end{itemize}
This gives the system the option of reducing the jerk on the high-gain position controlled actuators allowing for slower update rates on the reference channel.
The \textit{direct reference} mode allows a controller to have direct access to the commanded reference with no additional filtering.





Fig.~\ref{fig:timing-setRef} shows amount of time it takes to set the reference on the actuators via setting the data in the CAN bus buffer.
The amount of time it takes for the for the references to be set to the actuators via the CAN is dependent on the baud rate of the CAN bus.
Currently the baud rate is set to 1Mbps.
CAN is the limiting factor in the loop rate.
The table of the required bits to be sent via can is available in Table~\ref{table:huboCAN}.

Fig.~\ref{fig:timing-getPos}, \ref{fig:timing-imu}, \ref{fig:timing-acc}, \ref{fig:timing-ft} shows the amount of time it takes to request and get the state data from the actuator from over the CAN bus.
This takes in total $1.365~ms$ plus an additional $3.0~ms$ for wait-on-CAN to ensure all queued messages in the CAN buffer are send and received. 


Fig.~\ref{fig:timing-setstate} shows the amount of time it takes to set the state to the feedback channel.
The measured delay is $0.092~ms$ with a standard deviation of $0.091$.

Assuming no CAN delays Hubo-Ach can run at $1900~khz$.
With the current configuration of a 2 channel CAN bus it is restricted to below $237~hz$.
With a 4 channel CAN configuration it can be increased to $469~hz$.
With an 8 channel CAN configuration it can be increased to $1063~hz$.
