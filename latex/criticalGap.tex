Due to the high entry cost for high DOF robots the Hubo-Ach controller should be able to be tested on low/no \textit{cost to entry} systems.
This means the controller must be compatible with:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item virtual/simulated robot
\item kinematicly scaled robot
\item full-size robot
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}





It is evident that the critical gap is needing a \textit{unified algorithmic framework for high degree of freedom robots that allows for development on multiple platforms}.
This unified algorithmic framework connects the three robots above in the \textit{Three Tier Infrastructure}\cite{threeTier} for complex system development as described in Section~\ref{sec:threeTier}.
The idea for this infrastructure was first realized by a Partnerships for International Research and Education (PIRE) grant \#0730206, sponsored by the the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF).
This is the same grant in which this work is sponsored.
The three tiers include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Rapid Prototype (RP) phase with zero cost to entry (OpenHubo Platform Section~\ref{sec:openhubo})
\item Test and Evaluation (T\&E) phase with low cost to entry (Mini-Hubo Platform Section~\ref{sec:mini-hubo})
\item Verify and Validate (V\&V) phase with lease-time cost to entry (Hubo Platform Section~\ref{sec:hubo})
\end{itemize}
The unifying algorithmic framework called \textit{Hubo-Ach}\cite{lofaroRAM2013} is described in Section~\ref{sec:hubo-ach}.


As described above this work demonstrates that a multi-process, multi-rate control structure coupled with the proper timing mechanisms is conducive to creating this unified algorithmic framework.
Through verification and validation Hubo-Ach is shown to be a viable unifying algorithmic framework conducive to collaborative work.  
A road map of how this work began is shown in Section~\ref{sec:roadmap}.

An example of the three tier infrastructure being used to enable a high DOF robot to throw a ball is given in Section~\ref{sec:baseball}.
The methods used include a unique algorithm for end-effector velocity control called Sparse Reachable Maps (SRM) is explained in Section~\ref{sec:sec:srm}.
In addition an end-effector velocity control method is used in a live throwing experiment at a baseball game and described in Section~\ref{sec:finalDesign}.

The Hubo-Ach system is verified under many circumstances including:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Real-time closed form inverse kinematic controller (Section~\ref{sec:hubo-ach-kinimatics})
	\item Full body locomotive task of turning a valve (Section~\ref{sec:valve})
	\item Full body locomotive task of walking (Section~\ref{sec:OpenHuboWalking})
	\item Visual seroving while performing full body locomotive task (Section~\ref{sec:visuralServoing})
	\item Active damping via force-torque feedback (Section~\ref{sec:activedamping})
\end{itemize}




Hubo-Ach is then independently validated by other researcher through the examples of:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Door opening (Section~\ref{sec:hubo-achVerification})
	\item Dynamic walking (Section~\ref{sec:dynamicWalking})
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

A study/survey about how well the Hubo-Ach system performs as a \textit{unifying algorithmic framework} is given.  
Results and the questions are given in Section~\ref{sec:hubo-achSurvey}.

Lastly Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} discusses the results of the work and the future of this system.

\noindent \textit{Note:} This work has already been validated by pears in the field through:
\begin{itemize}
\item Use as the primary control system for the DARPA Robotics Challenge Track-A Team DRC-Hubo, Section~\ref{sec:drc}.
\item Used in the NSF-PIRE\footnote{NSF-PIRE: Partnerships for International Research
and Education (PIRE) \#0730206, sponsored by the the U.S. National
Science Foundation (NSF)} and NSF-MIRR\footnote{NSF-MIRR: Major Research Infrastructure Recovery and Reinvestment (MIRR) \#CNS-0960061 sponsored by the the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)} projects.
\item Various research being conducted using Hubo-Ach at MIT, WPI, Purdue, Ohio State, Swarthmore College, Georgia Tech, and Drexel University.
\end{itemize}
\noindent In addition more information on \textit{why this problem is hard} is in Section~\ref{sec:challenges}.

For the remainder of this document the focus will be on implementing this Unifying Algorithmic Framework on the different platforms of the three tier infrastructure.
These platforms are Hubo, Mini-Hubo, and OpenHubo.  
Detailed description of each of these robots are available in Section~\ref{sec:robots}.
