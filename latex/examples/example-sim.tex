The simulator used for Hubo-Ach is the OpenHubo.
OpenHubo is an open-source kinematic and dynamic simulator for the the Hubo2 and Hubo2+ series robots.
It was developed by the Drexel Autonomous Systems Lab and runs using the open-source robot simulation environment OpenRAVE\cite{diankovThesis}.
Fig.~\ref{fig:openhubbo} shows the OpenHubo shell model and collision model.

The masses and lengths are of the OpenHubo model are all based off of the CAD model.
The shell model includes an external skin based off of the CAD model of the Hubo's shell.
This model is high polygon count and thus tends to require more processing time to detect collisions.
The collision model is constructed out of primitives in order to decrease the complexity of the model and decrease required processing time.
The collision model is a representation of the shell model. 
It does not exactly fit the contours but through experimentation and use has been calibrated to be a good representation of the Hubo's outer shell.

Hubo-Ach is designed to run in either real-time or in simulation time.
This is especially useful when running experimental controllers and you do not want to damage the robot.
In real-time mode Hubo-Ach updates at its normal sampling period $T_{r}$.
Due to the complexity of the
