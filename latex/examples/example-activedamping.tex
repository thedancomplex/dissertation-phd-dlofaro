Using feedback from the force-torque sensors the Hubo-Ach controller adds compliance to the legs via active damping.
Fig.~\ref{fig:activedamping} shows as the user pushes down on the robot the force is detected by the force-torque (FT) sensors.
This then modifies the joint commands such that the center of mass (CoM) acts like there is an over-damped spring-damper system between it and mechanical ground.
