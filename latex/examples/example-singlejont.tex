This section shows the experimental and expected results of controlling a single joint via the Hubo-Ach system.
In this example the right shoulder pitch (RSP) is given a step input from 0.0 $rad$ to 0.4 $rad$.
The reference position $\theta_r$ is begin recorded as well as the actuator setpoint $\theta_c$ and
