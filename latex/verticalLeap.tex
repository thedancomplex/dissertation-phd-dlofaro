The primary contributions and vertical leap to the field of complete complex systems and robotics is the creation of control system that allows for fast parallel development of controllers for these complex systems in both physical and simulated environments.
Splitting each controller into separate processes allows for multiple control periods, robustness against complete system failure and is conducive for a parallel development environment.
The use of SI units for all \textit{state} data makes it non-robot specific.
Hubo-Ach is an Open-Source BSD licensed software allowing for open use.

The contributions of my thesis has been confirmed by multiple IEEE publications\cite{lofaroTePRA2013HuboAch,lofaroTePRA2013Valve}, in review for a publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Magazine (RAM)\cite{lofaroRAM2013} and has been the top featured video on the IEEE Spectrum \textit{Video Friday} article on December 14$^{th}$, 2012\cite{videoFriday}.
