\chapter{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
This work shows the successful creation of a \textit{Unified Algorithmic Framework for High Degree of Freedom Complex Systems and Humanoid Robots}.
It was shown that the Hubo-Ach system works as the unifying algorithmic framework for the three tier infrastructure described in Section~\ref{sec:threeTier}.
This means Hubo-Ach works with all three tiers including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Rapid Prototype (RP) phase with zero cost to entry (OpenHubo Platform Section~\ref{sec:openhubo})
\item Test and Evaluation (T\&E) phase with low cost to entry (Mini-Hubo Platform Section~\ref{sec:mini-hubo})
\item Verify and Validate (V\&V) phase with lease-time cost to entry (Hubo Platform Section~\ref{sec:hubo})
\end{itemize}

The three tier infrastructure was used to enable the robot to throw a ball.
This resulted in a unique algorithm for end-effector velocity control called Sparse Reachable Maps (SRM)(Section~\ref{sec:sec:srm}).
One end-effector velocity control method was used in a live throwing experiment at a baseball game (Section~\ref{sec:finalDesign}).
The challenges from this successful experiment was answered by the creation of the following controllers.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Challenge: Aiming the throw:} Answer: Visual seroving while performing full body locomotive task (Section~\ref{sec:visuralServoing})
	\item \textit{Challenge: Safely landing when throwing:} Answer: Active damping via force-torque feedback (Section~\ref{sec:activedamping})
\end{itemize}


The Hubo-Ach system was verified under many circumstances including:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Real-time closed form inverse kinematic controller (Section~\ref{sec:hubo-ach-kinimatics})
	\item Full body locomotive task of turning a valve (Section~\ref{sec:valve})
	\item Full body locomotive task of walking (Section~\ref{sec:OpenHuboWalking})
\end{itemize}

Hubo-Ach was independently validated by other researcher through the examples of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Door opening (Section~\ref{sec:hubo-achVerification})
	\item Dynamic walking (Appendix~\ref{sec:dynamicWalking})
\end{itemize}

A study/survey done on how well the Hubo-Ach system performs as a \textit{unifying algorithmic framework} returned positive results (Section~\ref{sec:hubo-achSurvey}).
The result is the creation of a truly \textit{Unified Algorithmic Framework for High Degree of Freedom Complex Systems and Humanoid Robots}.

\section{Future Work}
Future work includes applying the framework to the DRC-Hubo for the DARPA Robot Challenge.
In addition an over arching goal is to implement Hubo-Ach on other high DOF robots such as HRP-2, Baxter etc. thus creating a truly \textit{Unified Algorithmic Framework for High Degree of Freedom Complex Systems and Humanoid Robots}.
This will allow for a greater ease of controller sharing and increase positive research output.
