The primary contributions and vertical leap to the field is the creation of a \textit{unified algorithmic framework for high degree of freedom complex systems and humanoid robots}.
The resulting framework allows seamless integration of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Controllers running at different loop rates
\item Runs on multiple robots with no modification
\item Runs on simulated robots with no modification 
\item Inherent structure makes it more robust
\item Written in C for controller programing language interdependence (use C bindings in desired language)
\end{itemize}
The unified frame work Hubo-Ach is an Open-Source BSD licensed software allowing for open use.

The contributions of Hubo-Ach have been independently verified by external parties\cite{tepraDoor2013,tepraCut2013}.
Is has been validated by multiple IEEE publications\cite{lofaroTePRA2013HuboAch,lofaroTePRA2013Valve}, in review for a publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Magazine (RAM)\cite{lofaroRAM2013} and has been the top featured video on the IEEE Spectrum \textit{Video Friday} article on December 14$^{th}$, 2012\cite{videoFriday}.
