This section shows the experimental and expected results of controlling a single joint via the Hubo-Ach system.
In this example the right shoulder pitch (RSP) is given a step input from 0.0 $rad$ to 0.4 $rad$.
The reference position $\theta_r$ is begin recorded as well as the actuator setpoint $\theta_c$ and the actual position of the joint $\theta_a$.
These definitions are also available in Table~\ref{table:recorded}

Fig.~\ref{fig:singleJointStep} shows the results when a step input is applied and Hubo-Ach is in \textit{HUBO\_REF\_MODE\_REF\_FILTER} also know as pass-through mode.
This sets the what the desired reference on the \textbf{FeedForward} Hubo-Ach channel to the actuator's reference, i.e.:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:refrefmode}
 \theta_c(N) = \theta_r(N)
\end{equation}

Fig.~\ref{fig:hubo-ach-feedforward} shows the block diagram of the control setup.

As seen in Fig~\ref{fig:singleJointStep} $\theta_c$ tracks $\theta_r$ perfectly. As expected $\theta_a$ lags by a minimum of 1 time step $T$.  
This is the time it takes between sending $\theta_c$ to the actuator over the CAN bus plus the time it takes in receiving the feedback from the encoder of the motor over CAN.
The remainder of the lag is due to the rise time of the actuator.
This is different for each joint.
Because all major joints are high-gain PID the rise-time and overshoot is very small which makes the robot very stiff.
The total lag between commanding the joint on the \textbf{FeedForward} channel and the response of the actuator is:

\begin{equation}
t_{lag} = t_{filter} + t_{rise}
\end{equation}
