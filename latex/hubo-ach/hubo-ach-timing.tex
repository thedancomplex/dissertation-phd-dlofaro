  \caption{CPU utilization for the Hubo-Ach process when 1) idle, 2) under open-loop control, 3) reading the sensors, and 4) under closed-loop control.  
It is important to note that the cpu utilization stays within 0.3\% when idle and under closed loop control.
This means that the CPU utilization of Hubo-Ach is independent of the external control method.
Thus it will not add more to the CPU load under complex control schemes then under simple ones.}
