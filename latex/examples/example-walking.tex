This section shows two examples of how Hubo-Ach was used for stable walking.  
Section~\ref{sec:staticWalking} shows how the open loop static walking trajectory is created and run using Hubo-ach.
Section~\ref{sec:dynamicWalking} shows the result of a five day \textit{hack-a-thon} using Hubo-Ach to add dynamic walking capability.
