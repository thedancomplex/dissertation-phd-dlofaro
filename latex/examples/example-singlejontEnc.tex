Feedback filtering allows us to removes the requirement that we know the joint's current position.
Similar to Equation~\ref{eq:reffiltermode} this method sets $\theta_c$ based on a filter length $L$ and the current desired value $\theta_r$.
However instead of assuming that we know all past $\theta_r$ we use the actual position $\theta_a$.
This method add compliance in a similar way to that of Section~\ref{sec:singlejointRefComplience}.


\begin{equation}\label{eq:refencmode}
\theta_c(N) = \frac{\theta_a(N)\cdot\left(L-1\right) + \theta_r(N)}{L}
\end{equation}

This causes three major effects: 

\noindent \textbf{Effect 1:} The movement of the joint is guaranteed to be filtered even if the previous reference is unknown.

\noindent \textbf{Effect 2:} The steady state error of the feedback filtering method $\theta_e^{fbfilter}$ is greater than that of the PID error $\theta_e$ in the direction of the moment acting on the joint.

\begin{equation}
\theta_e^{fbfilter} > \theta_e
\end{equation}

\noindent \textbf{Effect 3:} The joint's compliance has increased due to the effect of the moment applied to the joint has on the steady state error.

Fig.~\ref{fig:singleJointStepFilteredFeedback} shows $\theta_r$ plotted against $\theta_c$ and $\theta_a$.  
$\theta_a$ not only lags behind $\theta_c$ but it also has a greater steady state error.
Fig.~\ref{fig:singleJointStepFilteredFeedbackMoment} shows how the steady state error $\theta_e^{fbfilter}$ increases with an applied moment.
This is where we get our compliance.
