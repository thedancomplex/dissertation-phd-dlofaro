\subsection{Introduction}

A complete autonomous system is an electro mechanical mechanism that is cabiable of making its own decisions.
The decisions made are high level and low level.
High level decisions take care of objectives such as \textit{where to go} and \textit{what to pick up}. 
These decisions are like our concious decisions.
Low level decisions take care of balancing, inverse kinimatics etc.
These decisions can be compaired to our unconscious responses to stimuli, such as balancing, sitting, breating etc.

My work shows an experimentally viable way of creating a complete autonomous system.  
As proof of viability I 


This is demonstrated through experimentation on multiple electro mechanical platforms.
The primary platform focused on in this document is the Hubo 2 and the Hubo 2+ full-size humanoid robot.
The Hubo platform is discribed in Section~\ref{sec:hubo}.




\begin{itemize}
\item Creating a system that can monitor its self
\item Avoid self collisions
\item Plan future movements
\item Proform these plans with a higher archical structure such that it stays stable and safe among all else.
