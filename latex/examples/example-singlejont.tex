This section shows the experimental and expected results of controlling a single joint via the Hubo-Ach system.
In this example the right shoulder pitch (RSP) is given a step input from 0.0 $rad$ to 0.4 $rad$.
The reference position $\theta_r$ is begin recorded as well as the actuator setpoint $\theta_c$ and the actual position of the joint $\theta_a$.
These definitions are also available in Table~\ref{table:recorded}

Fig.~\ref{fig:singleJointStep} shows the results when a step input is applied and Hubo-Ach is in \textit{HUBO\_REF\_MODE\_REF\_FILTER} also know as passthrough mode.
This sets the what the desired reference on the \textbf{FeedForward} Hubo-Ach channel to the actuator's reference, i.e.:

\begin{equation}
 \theta_c = \theta_r
\end{equation}
